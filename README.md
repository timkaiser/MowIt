# MowIt

## Project Description
This project came to life as part of the course "Von der Idee zum Produkt", 
where we had to develope a game for the generation 50+. My focus were people who do not have much experience with video games yet. I therefore tried to make this game as intuitive as possible. That's why it is intended to be played on tablets or smartphones.

## The Game
This game is a puzzlegame where you control a lawnmower that can only drive in one of four directions. 
The lawnmower only stops once it hits an obstacle or the edge of the level.

## How to play
Go to http://kaisertim.de/MowIt.html or download this project and use MowIt.exe or open the project in Unity.
